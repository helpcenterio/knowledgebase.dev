## Get Started
You have 2 options to begin using the template.
  
- You can download the latest release from [KnowledgeBase.dev](https://knowledgebase.dev)
- You can clone, fork or download this repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/helpcenterio/knowledgebase.dev) - `git clone git@github.com:helpcenterio/knowledgebase.dev.git`.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Once you've downloaded the template using your preferred method you can simpy edit the HTML files (`index.html`, `pages/category.html`, `pages/article.html`, `pages/search.html`) and create custom
CSS files that you should include after the default `main.css` to overwrite existing styles or to add new ones. To preview changes you can open any of the HTML files in the browser but it's better to start a simple HTTP server to serve them as otherwise some of the things might not get displayed properly.

To start a simple HTTP server with Node.js, you can use a package like [Serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve).

Or in case you have PHP installed on your environment you can start the built-in HTTP server like this:

    php -S localhost:9090

### Advanced Usage

You can also edit the SCSS files of the template and compile them with npm. While editing you can run `npm watch` which will listen for changes and  automatically build you SCSS files into CSS.
